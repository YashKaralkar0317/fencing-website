            <p>A fencing bout takes place on what is called a “strip” or “piste”, about 14 meters long and 2 meters
                wide. Two fencers’ weapons are each wired by a cord through their sleeve to an electric scoring machine
                paired with their opponent, and they next test that their weapons and cords are functioning correctly by
                touching their opponent on their target, a metallic garment called a lamé (except in the case that
                epeéists, who do not wear a lamé, test by touching the point to the guard of their opponent’s weapon).
                They return to their respective starting lines 4 meters apart, salute their opponent, put on their mask,
                and get in the en garde position, facing their opponent and ready to fence. The referee then calls the
                beginning of the bout. Fencers remain facing the direction of their opponent and are not to leave the
                strip during the bout.
            </p>

                The referee halts play when an action is completed, and determines each time which fencer won a touch
                until a winner is determined. In regular/preliminary competition between two fencers, the bout continues
                until one fencer has scored five touches, and in the direct elimination (DE) round of a tournament, it
                can go to 15 points, though the DE round can vary, depending on age classification of a competition or
                in team events. When the bout is over, both fencers return to their starting lines, remove their masks,
                salute each other, and approach to shake hands. Good sportsmanship maintains the dignity of the sport.
